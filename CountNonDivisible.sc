/*
You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

  For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

  A[0] = 3
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 2
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 6
For the following elements:

  A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
  Write a function:

object Solution { def solution(a: Array[Int]): Array[Int] }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

  Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

  A[0] = 3
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 2
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 6
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

  Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

object Solution {
  def solution(a: Array[Int]): Array[Int] = {
    val n = a.length
    val count = Array.ofDim[Int](2 * n + 1)
    val divisors = Array.ofDim[Int](2 * n + 1)

    for (i <- a.indices) count(a(i)) = count(a(i)) + 1

    var j = 1
    var k = 0
    while (j <= 2 * n) {
      k = j
      while (k <= 2 * n) {
        divisors(k) = divisors(k) + count(j)
        k = k + j
      }
      j = j + 1
    }

    a.indices.map(i => n - divisors(a(i))).toArray
  }
}

Solution.solution(Array(3, 1, 2, 3, 6))
